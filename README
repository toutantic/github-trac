The commit hook is designed to close or mark tickets that are attached to a commit message.


It searches commit messages for text in the form of:
    command #1
    command #1, #2
    command #1 & #2 
    command #1 and #2

Instead of the short-hand syntax "#1", "ticket:1" can be used as well, e.g.:
    command ticket:1
    command ticket:1, ticket:2
    command ticket:1 & ticket:2 
    command ticket:1 and ticket:2

The Code Browser

The code browser portion of the plugin is designed to replace the code browser built into Trac with a
redirect to the GitHub source browser.

In order for this to work properly, you still need to have Trac set to show a git repository. Turning this off
will not show source control links in other places (timeline). This git repository needs to be a synced clone of
your GitHub repository. Trac requires the GitPlugin in order to show a Git Repository: http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin


This plugin will attempt to intercept the /browser and /changeset url's and redirect you to the proper GitHub url.
